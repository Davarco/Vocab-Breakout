Game Manual:
- Move your bar with the left and right arrow keys, or the letters 'a' and 'd.'
- If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, it is game over. 
- Red bricks "contain" vocab words/definitions which require you to answer the question

The word/definition set is based on Laura Randazzo's vocab terms.
